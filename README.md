Codeship [API v2](https://apidocs.codeship.com/v2) client for Golang

## Documentation

[https://godoc.org/github.com/codeship/codeship-go](https://godoc.org/github.com/codeship/codeship-go)

## Usage

`go get -u github.com/codeship/codeship-go`

Package `codeship` provides a client for using the Codeship API v2.

```go
import codeship "github.com/codeship/codeship-go"
```

Create a new API Client:

```go
auth := codeship.NewBasicAuth("username", "password")
client, err := codeship.New(auth)
```

You must then scope the client to a single Organization that you have access to:

```go
org, err := client.Organization(ctx, "codeship")
```

You can then perform calls to the API on behalf of an Organization:

```go
projects, err := org.ListProjects(ctx)
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled automatically via the API Client using the provided authentication mechanism.

If you would like to manually re-authenticate, you may do this by calling the `Authenticate` method on the `client`:

```go
err := client.Authenticate(ctx)
```

## Response

All API methods also return a `codeship.Response` type that contains the actual `*http.Response` embedded as well as a `Links` type that contains information to be used for pagination.

## Pagination

Pagination is provided for all requests that can return multiple results. The methods that are able to be paginated all take a variable argument of type `PaginationOption` such as: `ListProjects(opts ...PaginationOption)`.

We have defined two helper functions, `Page` and `PerPage`, to make pagination easier.

Usage is as follows:

```go
// defaults to first page with page_size of 30
projects, resp, err := org.ListProjects(ctx)

// paging forwards with 50 results per page
for {
    if resp.IsLastPage() || resp.Next == "" {
        break
    }

    next, _ := resp.NextPage()

    projects, resp, _ = org.ListProjects(ctx, codeship.Page(next), codeship.PerPage(50))
}

// paging backwards with 50 results per page
for {
    if current, _ := resp.CurrentPage(); current == 1 || resp.Previous == "" {
        break
    }

    prev, _ := resp.PreviousPage()

    projects, resp, _ = org.ListProjects(ctx, codeship.Page(prev), codeship.PerPage(50))
}
```

## Logging

You can enable verbose logging of all HTTP requests/responses by configuring the `client` via the functional option `Verbose(verbose bool)` when instantiating the client:

```go
auth := codeship.NewBasicAuth("username", "password")
client, err := codeship.New(auth, codeship.Verbose(true))
```

The default logger logs to STDOUT but can be replaced by any instance of `*log.Logger`:

```go
var (
    buf    bytes.Buffer
    logger = log.New(&buf, "INFO: ", log.Lshortfile)
    auth   = codeship.NewBasicAuth("username", "password")
)

client, err := codeship.New(auth, codeship.Verbose(true), codeship.Logger(logger))
```
