# Codeship API (v2) Client for Go

[![Codeship Status for codeship/codeship-go](https://app.codeship.com/projects/c38f3280-792b-0135-21bb-4e0cf8ff365b/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/244943)

## Usage

`go get -u github.com/codeship/codeship-go`

This library is intended to make integrating with Codeship fairly simple.

To start, you need to import the package:

```go
package main

import (
    codeship "github.com/codeship/codeship-go"
)
```

This library exposes the package `codeship`.

Getting a new API Client from it is done by calling `codeship.New()`:

```go
client, err := codeship.New("username", "password")
```

You must then scope the client to a single Organization that you have access to:

```go
org, err := client.Scope(ctx, "codeship")
```

You can then perform calls to the API on behalf of an Organization:

```go
projects, err := org.ListProjects(ctx)
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled automatically via the API Client using the provided `username` and `password`.

If you would like to manually re-authenticate, you may do this by calling the `Authenticate` method on the `client`:

```go
err := client.Authenticate(ctx)
```

## Pagination

Pagination is provided for all requests that can return multiple results. The methods that are able to be paginated all contain the `WithPagination(opts ListOptions)` signature.

Usage is as follows:

```go
projects, resp, err := org.ListProjects()

// paging forwards
for {
    if resp.IsLastPage() || resp.Next == "" {
        break
    }

    next, _ := resp.NextPage()

    projects, resp, _ = org.ListProjectsWithPagination(codeship.ListOptions{
        Page: next,
    })
}

// paging backwards
for {
    if current, _ := resp.CurrentPage(); current == 1 || resp.Previous == "" {
        break
    }

    prev, _ := resp.PreviousPage()

    projects, resp, _ = org.ListProjectsWithPagination(codeship.ListOptions{
        Page: prev,
    })
}
```

## Logging

You can enable verbose logging of all HTTP requests/responses by configuring the `client` via the functional option `Verbose(verbose bool)` when instantiating the client:

```go
client, err := codeship.New("username", "password", codeship.Verbose(true))
```

The default logger logs to STDOUT but can be replaced by any instance of `*log.Logger`:

```go
var (
    buf    bytes.Buffer
    logger = log.New(&buf, "INFO: ", log.Lshortfile)
)

client, err := codeship.New("username", "password", codeship.Verbose(true), codeship.Logger(logger))
```
