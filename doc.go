Package codeship provides a client for using the Codeship API v2.

The Codeship API v2 documentation exists at: https://apidocs.codeship.com/v2

Usage:

    import codeship "github.com/codeship/codeship-go"

Create a new API Client:

    client, err := codeship.New("username", "password")

You must then scope the client to a single Organization that you have access to:

    org, err := client.Organization(ctx, "codeship")

You can then perform calls to the API on behalf of an Organization:

    projects, err := org.ListProjects(ctx)
